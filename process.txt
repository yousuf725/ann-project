ANN (I haave to build my model and then train it to make predictions)

1. Data Collection (csv , excel, database, api) done
2. Pre-processing (how to clean the data) done
3. Feature Engineering (converting textual data into numerical)
4. Scaling 
5. Train Test Split
6. Model build
7. Model Training
8. predictions
9. Deploymnt (local)
10.Deployment (Live) (Stremlit - Domain - API ) 

Mission = to create a predictive model that can predict on the basis of data
